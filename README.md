Overview
Welcome to the OSU_HRI_Project repository! Our project investigates the most socially appropriate ways for robots to interrupt conversations, aiming to facilitate smoother human-robot interactions (HRI) as robots become more integrated into society. We focus on mimicking and extending human non-verbal communication gestures to improve robot behavior in social contexts.

Objectives
Social Appropriateness: Identify and implement methods for robots to interrupt conversations in a socially acceptable manner.
Non-Verbal Communication: Emulate human non-verbal gestures and movements used during interruptions.
Technology Utilized:
Object Detection: Recognize and interpret conversational contexts and interactions.
Clustering: Analyze and categorize interrupting behaviors.
Movement Implementation: Enable the robot to perform socially appropriate gestures.
Project Structure
/src: Source code for core functionalities including object detection, clustering algorithms, and robot movement control.
/launch: Launch files for starting and managing different components of the project.
/scripts: Utility scripts for tasks such as data processing, model training, and evaluation.
/config: Configuration files for system settings, including parameters and environment-specific settings.
/urdf: URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files for defining the robot's physical properties and kinematics.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
ROS (Robot Operating System) if working with launch files
Required Python libraries: numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, opencv-python, tensorflow (or other frameworks as necessary)
Any additional dependencies specified in requirements.txt
